        <br>
        <h3>time since the world was supposed to end according to the mayans:</h3>
        <h6>(well, actually, according to random people in the 2000s. december 21st 2012 truly was just the end of a really long calendar, random people just thought that the end of the calendar meant the end of the world. too bad they were off by about 7 years. you can read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_phenomenon">this</a> i guess)</h6>
        <h3 id="sincemayaend">000:00:00:00</h3>

        <h3>time since the start of Y2K:</h3>
        <h6>(aka, 2000, which, coincidentally, is another day where people thought the world was going to end. okay, well, they thought that the computers would glitch out. which it kinda did, but not really. look, just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem">read the wikipedia article</a>)</h6>
        <h3 id="sincestart2000">000:00:00:00</h3>
        <h3>time since the moon landing:</h3>

        <br>
        <h3>time until the end of time:</h3>
        <h6>(okay, well, unix time. basically, once this countdown hits zero, the system which counts the time since january 1st 1970 will overflow, breaking a bunch of older computers that still use 32-bit integers. look <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem">at this article</a>)</h6>
